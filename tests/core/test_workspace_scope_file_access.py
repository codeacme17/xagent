"""Scope confinement for file-id resolution in TaskWorkspace.

`_file_record_allowed_for_workspace` gates `resolve_file_id`. Before this
change it keyed only on the owner `user_id` (+ optional task_id), so a scoped
task could resolve, by file_id, a record belonging to the same owner but a
different scope subtree (e.g. another end user's upload, `task_id=None`).
These tests pin the scope-subtree confinement, and confirm unscoped workspaces
keep the owner-only behavior byte-for-byte.
