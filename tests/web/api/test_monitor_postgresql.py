"""Monitoring endpoints against a real PostgreSQL database.

``monitor.py`` reads fields out of ``TraceEvent.data`` (a ``Column(JSON)``)
through a per-dialect helper. Its PostgreSQL branch is the one branch the
SQLite suite never executes, and it shipped ``~?`` -- an operator PostgreSQL
does not have for ``json``, ``jsonb`` or ``text``. Every query through that
branch therefore failed on PostgreSQL while SQLite CI stayed green, and each
call site swallowed the error into an empty result (#1149).

The two symptoms differ by endpoint, which is why all three are covered here:

- ``/monitor/stats`` raised. Its ``except`` substitutes ``active_models = 0``,
  but the failed statement leaves the transaction aborted, so the *next*
  query in the same session (the ``llm_call_end`` scan) raised
  ``PendingRollbackError`` outside any local handler and the request became a
  500.
- ``/monitor/popular-tools`` and ``/monitor/model-stats`` issue no further
  query after their handler, so they returned HTTP 200 with an empty list --
  a dashboard of zeros with nothing but a log line to show for it.

The seed data also pins which payloads the dialect guard drops. PostgreSQL
accepts several escape sequences into a ``json`` column that ``->>`` then
refuses to convert -- the NUL escape and either half of an unpaired UTF-16
surrogate -- and one such row fails the whole query. A *valid* surrogate pair
is not a hazard and must survive, so a non-BMP payload is seeded alongside.

Fixture pattern copied from
``tests/web/services/test_task_status_storage_postgresql.py`` (skip-if-unset
via ``XAGENT_TEST_POSTGRES_URL``; CI provides it in the PostgreSQL job).
