"""`/api/mcp/apps` must emit its attachability decisions, not their inputs
(#1347).

The connector picker used to reconstruct two decisions from
`is_connected` + `is_custom` + `auth_type`, which made three unstated backend
emission rules load-bearing on the client: that `is_connected` for an
mcp_oauth entry requires an active grant, that `auth_type` appears on a local
entry only alongside an active personal association, and that `is_custom` is
never set by the catalog branch. These tests pin `can_attach` and
`can_authorize` directly, so changing any of those rules fails here instead of
silently mis-gating the picker.

The two fields answer different questions and diverge on real populations:
a team-owned mcp_oauth connector is attachable but has no consent flow the
member could start, and a hook-resolved connector is attachable with no
consent flow existing at all.
