"""Regression coverage for connector-specific OAuth policy membership in
APPS_REQUIRING_APP_SCOPED_OAUTH_GRANT.

That set is hand-maintained (src/xagent/web/mcp_apps.py) with no mechanical
link to the builtin registry it protects: an app whose oauth_scopes need
something the provider's own default_scopes don't grant, but that's missing
from the set, fails silently -- a bare provider-level OAuth grant is treated
as sufficient, the app reports "connected", and every scope-gated tool call
then fails. This pins every connector currently documented by the policy,
including whatsapp, Planner, SharePoint, PowerPoint, Excel, and Word, so a
future edit cannot silently drop one.

The Microsoft provider is held to a mechanical invariant (see
test_every_microsoft_app_beyond_provider_defaults_requires_app_scoped_grant):
every builtin Microsoft app whose scopes exceed the provider's identity-only
default must be listed, so a new connector cannot silently omit itself.

That invariant is deliberately not extended to the other providers. A fully
general "every builtin oauth app whose scopes exceed its provider's
default_scopes must be listed here" rule does not hold across the registry
today: several unlisted apps under other providers (e.g. most google apps,
zoom, linear, xero, employment-hero) also request scopes beyond their
provider's default_scopes, and instagram is excluded on purpose so its
existing bare "meta" grants keep working. Closing that gap is a separate,
cross-connector decision.
